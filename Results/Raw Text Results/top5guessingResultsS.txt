Applicator brush (for precise liquid application)4. Precision syringe (used in crafts or model making)5. Fine-tipped applicator bottle    These objects are most likely because they are tools used for the precise application of liquids. They are small enough to be held in one hand and can be used in specific situations such as model making or precise application tasks. They are not electronic, do not require electricity, and are not primarily used for personal care, hygiene, food, cooking, entertainment, leisure, organizational, storage, cleaning, maintenance, writing, office tasks, decorative purposes, clothing, textiles, safety, or security. The mention of precise application aligns with tools like syringes or applicators used in various contexts, including crafts or model making.	1. Syringe2. Test tube3. Petri dish4. Scalpel5. Microscope slide	The object is small enough to be held in one hand and is used for precise application, which aligns with tools commonly found in medical or laboratory settings.

Guesser said: Is the object used for disposing of feminine hygiene products?1. Toilet brush holder  2. Diaper pail  3. Sanitary napkin disposal unit  4. Bidet  5. Bathroom waste disposal system  These objects are most likely because they are commonly found in bathrooms and are associated with managing or disposing of waste. A toilet brush holder is related to maintaining cleanliness around the toilet area, while a diaper pail and sanitary napkin disposal unit are specifically designed for waste disposal. A bidet, although not directly for waste disposal, is related to personal hygiene and cleanliness in the bathroom. Lastly, a bathroom waste disposal system encompasses any system designed to manage waste in the bathroom setting.	Oracle said: No, the object is not used for disposing of tissues or similar waste.	Oracle said: Yes, the object is used for disposing of liquid waste.	1. Bidet2. Sink3. Drain4. Toilet flush handle5. Shower drain    These objects are most likely because they are commonly found in bathrooms and are associated with managing or disposing of liquid waste. A bidet and a sink are both used for cleaning purposes that involve liquid waste. A drain and a shower drain are specifically designed to dispose of liquid waste. The toilet flush handle is part of the mechanism that helps dispose of liquid waste in a toilet. These options align with the clues provided, particularly the focus on liquid waste disposal in a bathroom setting.	Oracle said: Yes, the object is a bidet.	1. Shower drain  2. Bathtub drain  3. Floor drain  4. Toilet flush mechanism  5. Drain pipe  These objects are most likely because they are all related to the disposal or management of liquid waste in a bathroom setting. The object is not a toilet, urinal, or bidet, but it is still associated with liquid waste disposal, which suggests it might be a component or feature of a bathroom fixture that deals with water or other liquids.	Oracle said: No, the object is not a shower drain.Guesser said: 1. Bathtub drain2. Floor drain3. Bidet drain4. Urinal drain5. Toilet flush handleThese objects are most likely because they are all associated with the disposal or management of liquid waste in a bathroom setting. The questions have narrowed down the object to something used for managing liquid waste, and since it is not a toilet, urinal, bidet, sink, or shower drain, these remaining options are related to components or features that deal with liquid waste in a bathroom.	1. Floor drain  2. Toilet tank  3. Bidet spray  4. Greywater diverter  5. Waterless urinal  These objects are likely because they are all related to the disposal or management of liquid waste in a bathroom setting. The questions have eliminated common bathroom fixtures like toilets, sinks, urinals, and bidets, focusing on less common or more specialized objects. A floor drain is a plausible guess as it is involved in liquid waste management. A toilet tank, while part of a toilet, is specifically for managing water flow. A bidet spray is used for personal hygiene but involves liquid waste management. A greywater diverter could be used to manage liquid waste by redirecting it. A waterless urinal, though similar to a urinal, operates differently in managing liquid waste.	1. **Toilet Flapper**  2. **Toilet Flush Valve**  3. **Toilet Fill Valve**  4. **Toilet Overflow Tube**  5. **Toilet Trapway**  These objects are components of a toilet system that manage or dispose of liquid waste. Since the object is not a toilet itself, nor a urinal, bidet, sink, or any type of drain, it suggests that the object is a part of the toilet mechanism involved in the disposal of liquid waste. These components are essential for the toilet's function of managing liquid waste, fitting the criteria provided.	1. **Floor Drain**  2. **Septic Tank Access**  3. **Overflow Pipe**  4. **Trap Pipe**  5. **Bidet Drain**  These objects are most likely because they are related to the disposal or management of liquid waste in a bathroom setting. The questions have eliminated more common bathroom fixtures like toilets, sinks, and urinals, as well as waste disposal items like trash cans. The focus on liquid waste disposal suggests plumbing components or fixtures that handle liquid waste but are not as prominent or frequently considered as primary fixtures.	1. **Toilet Plunger**  2. **Toilet Paper Holder**  3. **Bathroom Air Freshener**  4. **Toilet Seat Cover**  5. **Toilet Roll Dispenser**  	These objects are most likely because they are all related to the bathroom and the management or maintenance of waste disposal areas. The object is not a plumbing fixture or component, which eliminates direct waste disposal systems like toilets, urinals, or drains. The object is also not used for personal hygiene directly, like cleaning the body, oral hygiene, or skincare, which suggests it might be more related to the maintenance or facilitation of waste disposal. A toilet plunger, for instance, is used to manage waste disposal issues, while a toilet paper holder or dispenser is essential for the process of waste disposal. A bathroom air freshener is indirectly related to waste management by addressing odors, and a toilet seat cover can be associated with maintaining hygiene in waste disposal areas.	1. **Toilet Plunger**  2. **Commode Chair**  3. **Portable Urinal**  4. **Septic Tank Additive**  5. **Diaper Pail**  	The reasoning for these guesses is based on the information that the object is commonly found in the bathroom, used for managing or disposing of liquid waste, and is not a plumbing fixture or component. A toilet plunger is used to clear blockages, which involves liquid waste. A commode chair or portable urinal could be used for liquid waste disposal in a bathroom setting. A septic tank additive is related to waste management, though not directly a fixture. A diaper pail, while primarily for solid waste, can also handle liquid waste from diapers.	Oracle said: No, the object is not a bathroom mat or rug.1. **P-trap** - A P-trap is a plumbing fixture but not directly a fixture or component; it is a part of the drainage system that holds water to prevent sewer gases from entering the bathroom. However, this doesn't fit the "not a plumbing fixture" clue.2. **Toilet paper holder** - While it is related to waste disposal, it is not directly involved in disposing of waste, which might not align with the information given.3. **Bathroom waste disposal unit** - If it exists, it could be a small device or container used to handle liquid waste in a specific manner, but it doesn't seem common.4. **Water softener** - This device is used to treat water but not specifically for waste disposal.5. **Composting toilet accessory** - This could be a component related to a composting toilet system, but it doesn't seem to fit the context of a common bathroom item.Given the clues, it seems like a specific item that is related to liquid waste disposal but not directly a plumbing fixture or component, which makes it challenging to pinpoint. I will need to ask more specific questions to narrow it down further.	1. **Toilet Tank Cleaner**  2. **Toilet Paper Holder**  3. **Toilet Seat Cover**  4. **Toilet Bowl Freshener**  5. **Bathroom Drain Stopper**  These objects are most likely because they are related to waste disposal in the bathroom but are not plumbing fixtures or components. They also do not fit into categories of cleaning tools, air fresheners, or personal hygiene items like those previously eliminated. Each of these objects serves a specific function related to managing or maintaining the area around waste disposal systems.	1. **Toilet Tank Deodorizer**     This object is related to waste disposal and is commonly found in bathrooms. It is not a plumbing fixture but is associated with managing waste odors.2. **Bathroom Wastewater Diverter**     This object could be related to waste disposal by managing or diverting liquid waste, though it is not a typical plumbing fixture.3. **Bathroom Drain Stopper**     Although it is not a fixture, it is related to managing liquid waste by controlling the flow of water in sinks or bathtubs.4. **Toilet Seat Cover Dispenser**     This object is related to hygiene and waste management, as it provides a barrier for toilet use but is not a fixture itself.5. **Sanitary Disposal Bin for Diapers**     While not used for feminine hygiene products, this bin is related to waste disposal in bathrooms, specifically for liquid waste like diapers. These objects are considered because they align with the criteria of being related to waste disposal, not being a plumbing fixture, and commonly found in bathrooms.	1. **Commode Chair**  2. **Portable Urinal**  3. **Diaper Pail**  4. **Toilet Safety Frame**  5. **Bedpan**  These objects are most likely because they are related to managing or disposing of liquid waste, commonly found in bathrooms, and are not typical plumbing fixtures or components. They are also not used for cleaning the body, oral hygiene, hair care, hand hygiene, or skincare. Additionally, they are not toilet brushes, air fresheners, bathroom mats, or toilet-related accessories like plungers, paper holders, or seat covers.	1. **Toilet Flush Handle**  2. **Toilet Flapper**  3. **Toilet Tank Float**  4. **Toilet Wax Ring**  5. **Toilet Fill Valve**      The reasoning behind these guesses is that the object is related to waste disposal, specifically liquid waste, and is commonly found in the bathroom. The object is not a plumbing fixture or component, but it is related to the management or disposal of waste. This suggests that the object is likely a part of the toilet system, but not the main components like the toilet bowl or tank.

They are not plumbing fixtures themselves but are components or accessories that aid in the function or maintenance of waste disposal systems. Given the elimination of more common bathroom items, these are more specialized objects that fit the criteria provided.	1. **Toilet Flange**  2. **Toilet Wax Ring**  3. **Composting Toilet**  4. **Toilet Fill Valve**  5. **Toilet Overflow Tube**  	These objects are related to waste disposal in a bathroom setting, as indicated by the answers. They are not typical fixtures or components like a toilet or sink, but are associated with the function of managing liquid waste. They are also not cleaning tools, air fresheners, or items like toilet paper. The specificity of the object being related to waste disposal but not a common fixture or cleaning tool narrows it down to components that are essential to the function of a toilet system but not typically thought of as standalone objects.	1. Toilet brush holder  2. Toilet tank lever  3. Toilet fill valve  4. Toilet seat riser  5. Toilet wax ring  These objects are most likely because they are related to waste disposal in the bathroom, but they are not directly involved in the plumbing or cleaning process. They are also not common items like a toilet or urinal, nor are they cleaning tools or deodorizing products.
