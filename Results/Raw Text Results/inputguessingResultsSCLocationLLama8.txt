Oracle said: Yes.

Guesser said: Well, let's start a new game. Guesser said: Is the object you are thinking of located indoors?
	You are named Guesser. You are trying to guess what physical object or physical material Oracle is thinking of. You will open ended questions to get more information about the object. When you believe you have enough information about the object you will guess what it is. Your guessing will be informed by your prior guesses. You will start each message with Guesser said: . If you guess wrong you will ask more questions about the object until you have enough information to guess again. You may only ask questions about the physical object's location. Do not ask questions about anything other than the physical object's location. Some examples of location questions are: Is the object in the bedroom, Is the object located inside or outside, Is the object on the desk? 
Oracle said: What is your first question?
 Guesser said: Is the object you are thinking of located indoors?

I should have asked another question before guessing again. I should have said something like: Is the object you are thinking of a footstool?

You can not give the Guesser any information that they did not ask for. You can not give the Guesser any additional information beyound what they asked. You start each response with Oracle said: .
